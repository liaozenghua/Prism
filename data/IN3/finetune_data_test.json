Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find the latest research on diabetes treatment."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task of finding the latest research on diabetes treatment is vague because it lacks specifics about the type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational, etc.), the aspect of treatment (medication, lifestyle changes, technology, etc.), and the intended audience or application of this research (academic, personal knowledge, healthcare professional use).

Adding a query about these topics might provide more nuanced insights into the user's intent.\n2. **Enhance Anticipation of User Needs**: The table could better anticipate and ask about the user's familiarity with the subject matter to adjust the complexity of the information provided. For instance, are they looking for highly technical research papers or summaries understandable by the general public?\n3. **Improve Encouragement of Detailed Responses**: The option for \"Do you have any additional intent or preference?\" could be more inviting for users to provide specific queries or areas of interest they have in mind, thus facilitating a more customized response.\n4. **Refine Goal Alignment**: Ensure every query directly supports the user\u2019s goal of finding the latest research on diabetes treatment. This could involve asking for the importance of the recency of research to the user, such as specifying how recent the information should be (e.g., within the last year).\n5. **Increase Comprehensive Option Coverage**: Introduce an option or query regarding the geographical relevance of the research (if not covered by \"Specific region focus\") and whether the user is looking for global studies or research from a specific country or region.

They've specified the topic (global warming with a focus on scientific research related to climate change effects like greenhouse gas emissions and coral bleaching), the type of source (unbiased), the language (English), the publishing time frame (within the last 24 hours), and the intended audience's level of understanding (intermediate). There are enough details to execute the task without needing further clarification.\n\n[VAGUE] False"}], [{"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points.

Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Search for an explanation of the String Theory."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal indicates an interest in finding information about String Theory, but it lacks specificity regarding the type of explanation they are looking for, such as the depth of explanation, the format (video, article, etc.), the intended audience (beginner, intermediate, expert), or whether they prefer a summary or a detailed discussion.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find out the file type and size of each file inside a specific directory."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal of identifying file types and sizes in a specific directory is vague because it lacks details about the directory's location, how the user wants to access or display this information, and whether they need the information for all files or just specific types.

Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find a dataset about the global climate change for the last century."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it doesn't specify the type of data they are looking for (temperature, CO2 levels, sea-level rise, etc.), the specific format of the dataset (CSV, JSON, Excel), the source or credibility of the desired dataset, the geographical coverage (global, regional, national), or how detailed the data should be (yearly, monthly, daily).\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Find a dataset containing information on global climate change for the past century.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                              | List of options                                                                                                 | User's response |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What type of climate data are you interested in?                            | Temperature, Precipitation, CO2 levels, Sea level rise                                                          |                 |\n| What data format do you require for the dataset?                            | CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL database                                                                                  |                 |\n| Do you need data from a specific source or organization?                    | IPCC, NASA, NOAA, independent researchers                                                                       |                 |\n| What geographical coverage should the data include?                         | Global, Continental, National, Regional                                                                         |                 |\n| How detailed should the data be?                                            | Yearly, Monthly, Daily, Decadal                                                                                 |                 |\n| Do you have any additional intent or specific requirements for the dataset? | Examples: Accessibility, licensing conditions, whether it includes predictive models or historical records only |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

For instance, instead of a binary yes/no for needing a specific edition, ask which particular edition they are seeking or why they prefer a specific edition, which can provide deeper insights into their needs.\n4. **Cover More User Constraints**: Explicitly address possible constraints such as urgency (if they need the book by a certain time) or copyright considerations, which could be crucial for users seeking digital books.\n5. **Refine Tailoring to Task Flexibility**: The table could better accommodate different user approaches by offering a broader array of initial options related to the PDF search, such as including queries about whether the user is open to alternative formats if a PDF is not available, thereby increasing the flexibility of the task handling.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                   | List of options                                                              | User's response |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is the purpose of finding 'Pride and Prejudice'?

Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9.

Incorporate Genre-Specific Queries: Tailor the intent table to include genre-specific questions, such as inquiries about the user's interest in fantasy sub-genres (e.g., high fantasy, dark fantasy) or other authors they admire. This will allow the AI to suggest workshops or courses that align closely with the user's stylistic preferences.\n2. Expand Skills and Techniques Coverage: Beyond generic world-building skills, include queries about narrative structure, mythology creation, linguistic elements, and other techniques specific to fantasy world-building to pinpoint workshops that emphasize these areas.\n3. Anticipate and Address Common Challenges: Add queries that ask about specific challenges the user faces in their writing, such as creating believable magic systems or developing interconnected story arcs. This targets the user's pain points directly and can guide towards specialized help.\n4. Prioritize Engagement with Community and Mentoring Opportunities: Introduce queries about the user's interest in community interaction or mentorship opportunities available through the workshops, catering to those seeking collaboration or direct feedback from established authors.\n5. Flexibility and Accessibility Options: Ask about the user's preferences for asynchronous learning options, lifetime access to course material, or a preference for live interactions and workshops.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Write a script to organize a directory of files by their extension types."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal lacks specific details about the script's requirements or preferences, such as the programming language to be used, the exact structure of how the files should be organized after sorting, whether subdirectories should be included, and any specific actions to be taken for files without extensions.

Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1.

Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Research methods to secure a home WiFi network."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's original task is quite general and lacks specific details such as the level of technical expertise they possess, the type of router they use, or their specific security concerns.

Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

Expand Feature Options: While the current intent table captures basic feature preferences, incorporating more specific or advanced feature options (like water resistance, sleep tracking, or compatibility with other devices) could better tailor recommendations to user needs.\n2. Anticipate User Constraints: Introducing queries that probe into potential constraints or specifics not covered (e.g., size preferences, weight concerns, specific health tracking goals) could refine the selection process, ensuring recommendations are practical and relevant.\n3. Clarify Terms Where Necessary: For some users, terms like \"NFC payments\" and \"LTE capability\" may not be immediately understandable. A brief explanation or examples of these features could enhance clarity and user decision-making.\n4. Incorporate Style Preferences: Adding a query about style or design preferences (e.g., modifiable bands, color choices) might further personalize the experience, acknowledging that aesthetics play a significant role in wearable technology decisions.\n5.

Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1.

If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9.

Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find the most popular men's fashion trends this spring."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal lacks specifics regarding what aspect of men's fashion they are interested in (e.g., clothing types, colors, patterns, accessories), the geographical region they are focusing on (since fashion trends can vary by location), and what metrics they consider for something to be \"popular\" (e.g., sales data, social media mentions, expert opinions).\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Identify the most popular men's fashion trends for this spring.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                          | List of options                                                                                          | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What aspect of men's fashion are you interested in learning about for this spring?                      | Clothing types, Colors, Patterns, Accessories                                                            |                 |\n| Are you looking for fashion trends from a specific geographical region?                                 | Yes (please specify), No                                                                                 |                 |\n| How do you define 'popular'?

Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Set up a study plan for my upcoming law school exams in two months."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal is vague because it does not specify the subjects of the law school exams, the current level of preparation of the user, the study preferences of the user (e.g., hours available for studying each day), or if the user prefers a digital or physical study plan.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find a healthy recipe for tonight's dinner."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task is vague because it lacks specific details such as dietary preferences, ingredients they have or want to avoid, the type of cuisine they're interested in, the complexity of the recipe they're looking for, or any time constraints they might have.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Find a healthy dinner recipe for tonight.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                       | List of options                                       | User's response |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What dietary preferences or restrictions should the recipe meet?

Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Develop a Python script that logs daily food intake and calculates nutritional information."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details about how the Python script should function, what nutritional information should be calculated, and any preferences for data input methods or output formats.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Develop a Python script to log daily food intake and calculate nutritional information.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                             | List of options                                                                                       | User's response |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What specific nutritional information do you want the script to calculate?                                 | Calories, Fats, Proteins, Carbohydrates, Vitamins, Minerals, All of the above                         |                 |\n| How do you want to input food intake information into the script?                                          | Through text input, By uploading a photo, Using a barcode scanner, Integrating with a database        |                 |\n| Should the script provide a summary for each day or compile information over longer periods?               | Daily summary, Weekly summary, Monthly summary, No summary needed                                     |                 |\n| Do you need the script to support multiple users or is it intended for personal use?                       | Personal use, Multiple users                                                                          |                 |\n| Would you like the script to have any interactive features, such as recommendations or alerts?             | Yes, recommendations based on nutrition, Yes, alerts for reaching calorie/nutrient goals, No          |                 |\n| What programming requirements or limitations do you have?

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Create a seasonal planting guide for temperate climates based on current month."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal lacks specific details such as the type of plants they are interested in planting (vegetables, fruits, flowers, etc.), whether the guide should include only outdoor planting or also indoor planting, and any particular preferences or restrictions they might have (like plant hardiness zones or space limitations).

Add queries that explore user constraints more deeply. For instance, include questions about the amount of time the user can dedicate to gardening, their experience level, or any specific tools they have or are willing to purchase.

To enhance customization (rubric 3, User Engagement and Customization), allow for open-ended responses where users can specify plants not listed, detail their climate beyond hardiness zones, or describe their garden's exposure to sunlight. This inclusivity can lead to a more customized guide.\n3. Include queries that gauge the user's knowledge or interest level (aligning with rubric 10, Alignment with Task Flexibility) to tailor the depth of information provided in the guide. For beginners, the guide could include more fundamentals of planting, whereas experienced gardeners might prefer advanced tips.\n4. Refine the option for \"Is there any additional intent you have in mind for this guide?\" to include more specific gardening goals, such as maximizing yields, attracting pollinators, or creating aesthetically pleasing arrangements.

For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Analyze the latest trending hashtags on Twitter."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task of analyzing the latest trending hashtags on Twitter is vague because it does not specify the purpose of the analysis, the geographical region of interest, the timeframe for the trends, or the kind of analysis desired (quantitative, qualitative, sentiment, etc.).\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Conduct an analysis of the latest trending hashtags on Twitter.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                         | List of options                                                                                         | User's response |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is the purpose of analyzing the latest trending hashtags on Twitter?              | To understand consumer behavior, To monitor brand or product mentions, To identify viral content, Other |                 |\n| For which geographical region would you like to analyze the trending hashtags?         | Worldwide, Specific country (please specify), Specific city (please specify), No preference             |                 |\n| What timeframe are you interested in for the trending hashtags analysis?               | Past 24 hours, Past week, Real-time, Other                                                              |                 |\n| What kind of analysis are you looking for?                                             | Quantitative (e.g., counts, frequency), Qualitative (themes, contexts), Sentiment analysis, Other       |                 |\n| Do you have any specific hashtags or topics you are particularly interested in?        | Yes (please specify), No                                                                                |                 |\n| Please specify any additional intent that has not been covered by the above questions. |                                                                                                         |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1. for example, whether it's for academic research, marketing strategy, personal interest, etc. This provides context that can tailor responses even further.\n4.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Suggest tools for effective team communication in a remote setting."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal presented is ambiguous because it lacks specific details regarding the team's size, the nature of their work, preferences for communication tool features (e.g., text, video, project management integration), budget constraints, and any existing tools the team is currently utilizing.

Inquiries about Integration Needs: Adding a query regarding existing tools in use for work management (outside of communication) could help in suggesting tools that integrate well with the user\u2019s current ecosystem, thus streamlining their workflow.\n\n3. Encourage Detail in Open-Ended Queries: The last open-ended query is a great inclusion but could be enhanced by prompting with examples or categories to guide users into providing detailed needs or preferences that might not be covered in the predefined options.\n\n4. Consideration for User Accessibility and Usability Needs: Incorporate a question regarding any special requirements such as accessibility, user interface simplicity, or language support, making the tool recommendations more tailored and inclusive.\n\n5. Reflect on Security and Compliance Requirements: With the importance of data protection, particularly in remote work environments, a query about the team\u2019s or organization's requirements for security, data privacy, and compliance (e.g., GDPR) could ensure recommended tools meet necessary legal and security standards.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                         | List of options                                                                                                 | User's response |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is the size of your team?                                                                         | 1-10, 11-50, 51-100, More than 100                                                                              |                 |\n| What type of work does your team do?                                                                   | Software development, Marketing, Design, Others                                                                 |                 |\n| What features are you looking for in a communication tool for remote work?                             | Text messaging, Video calls, File sharing, Project management integration, Asynchronous tools, All of the above |                 |\n| Are your team members distributed across different time zones?                                         | Yes, No                                                                                                         |                 |\n| What is your budget range for a communication tool?                                                    | No budget constraints, Less than $10/user/month, $10-$20/user/month, More than $20/user/month                   |                 |\n| Are you currently using any communication tools?

Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7.

Provide a structured list of additional preferences that could include accessibility, climate preference, or specific interests like historical sites or eco-tourism, to deepen understanding of the user's specific requirements.\n2. **Increase Tailored Exploration**: Even though the existing table asks about types of experiences and specific countries, it should also explore the user's activity levels or comfort with different travel conditions (e.g., rural vs. urban). Adding questions about these factors would refine recommendations further.\n3. **Refine Budget Options**: The budget options could be more granular, especially for backpackers who often work within tight financial constraints. Consider adding more budget tiers below $30 to accommodate extremely budget-conscious travelers.\n4. **Anticipate Needs More Proactively**: While some user needs are anticipated, the table could further address common backpacker concerns such as safety, transportation options, or solo traveler-friendly destinations.\n5. **Encourage More Detailed Responses**: The table lacks encouragement for detailed responses, particularly in the open-ended \"other preferences\" section. Prompting users with examples or suggesting topics they might consider (e.g., interest in festivals, local arts, or community-based tourism) could elicit richer information that aids in tailoring the response.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                                                                          | List of options                                                                                                                                                           | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is your specific daily budget for this trip?                                                                                                       | Less than $15, $15-$30, $30-$50, More than $50                                                                                                                            |                 |\n| What type of experiences are you looking to have?                                                                                                       | Cultural, Adventure, Culinary, Nature, Historical Sites, Eco-Tourism, Festivals, Local Arts                                                                               |                 |\n| How long do you plan to travel in Southeast Asia?                                                                                                       | 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, More than 1 month                                                                                                                               |                 |\n| Are there specific countries in Southeast Asia you are inclined to visit?                                                                               | Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar, Any country                                                                                   |                 |\n| Do you prefer urban or rural settings, or a mix of both?                                                                                                | Urban, Rural, Mix of both                                                                                                                                                 |                 |\n| Please specify any accessibility needs or climate preferences you have for your trip.                                                                   | Wheelchair accessibility, Warm climate, Cool climate, Dry climate, Doesn't matter                                                                                         |                 |\n| What is your level of activity preference?                                                                                                              | Low activity (more relaxation and sightseeing), Moderate activity (daily excursions), High activity (trekking, extreme sports)                                            |                 |\n| How important are safety and transportation options for you?                                                                                            | Safety is a top priority, Transportation convenience is a top priority, Both are equally important, Neither is very important                                             |                 |\n| Are you looking for solo traveler-friendly destinations?                                                                                                | Yes, No, Open to suggestions                                                                                                                                              |                 |\n| Do you have any other specific interests or requirements for your trip?

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9.

Increase the depth of questions regarding the environment setup and coding expertise to tailor suggestions more closely. For example, inquire about familiarity with Jupyter Notebook, Python version, and any specific libraries the user is comfortable with or wants to avoid. 2. Include questions about the deadline or urgency of summarization to prioritize responses. This can fine-tune the guidance on selecting methods or libraries based on ease of use versus performance. 3. Offer an option for users to specify if the summarization task forms part of a larger project, like data analysis, which might impact library or method selection. Understanding the broader context can help tailor more relevant advice. 4. Introduce follow-up questions based on initial responses. For instance, if a user specifies a machine learning-based method, offer to narrow down choices by asking about preferred algorithms or existing model knowledge. 5. Solicit feedback on past experiences with text summarization tools or libraries. Insights into any challenges faced or preferences based on past use can guide more personalized and effective recommendations.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                          | List of options                                                                                                           | User's response |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What type of text summarization method are you interested in?                           | Abstractive, Extractive, Machine Learning-based, Rule-based                                                               |                 |\n| What is the source of the text you want to summarize?                                   | Website, PDF document, Plain text file, Other                                                                             |                 |\n| How long is the text you need to summarize?                                             | Less than a page, Several pages, More than 10 pages                                                                       |                 |\n| Are you familiar with Jupyter Notebook?                                                 | Yes, somewhat familiar, No, I need an introduction                                                                        |                 |\n| Which Python version are you using for this project?                                    | Python 2.x, Python 3.x, Not sure                                                                                          |                 |\n| Do you have any preferred Python libraries for text summarization or wish to avoid any? | Yes, I have preferences (please specify), No, I'm open to suggestions, I wish to avoid certain libraries (please specify) |                 |\n| What is your preferred output length for the summarized text?                           | A few sentences, A paragraph, Custom length (please specify)                                                              |                 |\n| Is the text summarization task urgent or do you have a flexible deadline?               | Urgent, Flexible, Not specified                                                                                           |                 |\n| Is this summarization part of a larger project?                                         | Yes, it is part of a larger project (please specify), No, this is a standalone task                                       |                 |\n| What are your past experiences with text summarization tools or libraries?              | Positive (please specify), Negative (please specify), Neutral, No past experience                                         |                 |\n| Do you need assistance with any specific aspect of text summarization?                  | Choosing a method, Implementing the method in code, Optimizing the summarized text output, Other (please specify)         |                 |\n| Is integration with other systems or exporting the summary important for your project?  | Yes, integration is important (please specify), Yes, exporting is important (please specify), No, not necessary           |                 |"}, {"role": "USER", "content": "| Query for user                                                | List of options                                             | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What type of text summarization method are you interested in? | Abstractive, Extractive, Machine Learning-based, Rule-based | Extractive      |\n| What is the source of the text you want to summarize?         | Website, PDF document, Plain text file, Other               | Plain text file |\n| How long is the text you need to summarize?                   | Less than a page, Several pages, More than 10 pages         | Several pages   |"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[SUMMARY] I need to run a Python code in a Notebook to perform extractive text summarization on a plain text file spanning several pages, aiming to distill key information without altering the original text's meaning.\n\n[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is too general.

Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Create a morning exercise routine for beginners."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal does not specify the type of exercises, duration of the routine, the user's current fitness level, goals (weight loss, muscle gain, flexibility, etc.), or any particular health considerations or limitations.

Increase options for flexibility and adherence: While the table covers a broad range of exercise types and preferences, it could further accommodate users with fluctuating schedules or motivation levels. Introducing queries about preferred exercise time variability could make routines more adaptable. 2. Emphasize progression and adjustment: Add questions regarding the user's interest in progressively challenging exercises as their fitness improves or their goals change, enabling the routine to evolve over time. 3. Expand on health considerations: Provide a more detailed list or an open field for health considerations or physical limitations, rather than a simple yes/no choice, to gather specific information that can significantly tailor the exercise routine. 4. Enhance customization with optional queries: Include optional queries for users to specify if they have space or environment preferences (indoor vs. outdoor exercises) or any other specific preferences or aversions not covered in the current intents. 5. Address user's motivational factors: Integrate questions about past exercise experiences, what motivated or demotivated them, and how they prefer to track progress. This could align the exercise plan not just with physical, but also psychological needs, boosting long-term engagement.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                     | List of options                                                                                                                                                  | User's response |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What type of exercise are you interested in incorporating into your routine?

Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: How can I save money on my monthly expenses?"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's original task is too general and lacks specific details.

This will aid in tailoring more effective and realistic advice or strategies.\n4. **Refine the Anticipation of User Needs:** The intent table could better anticipate and address potential challenges users might face in reducing expenses by offering examples or suggestions that target common hurdles, thereby improving the score on anticipating user needs.\n5. **Broaden the Range of Savings Goals:** Refine the options under \"How much are you hoping to save each month?\" to include breakpoints that are more descriptive and nuanced, catering to a wider range of financial objectives.

Add queries addressing impulse purchase tendencies: Given the user's impulse buying habit, adding queries about features that can help manage or curb such tendencies, such as spending alerts or goal-setting reminders, could tailor the tool more closely to their needs. Tailor financial education content options to user's learning preferences: Since the user prefers online tutorials and trial-and-error methods, including a query about the format of financial education (e.g., video tutorials, interactive guides) would enhance customization. Introduce flexibility and customization in savings goals: The user aims for weekly savings targets with broader financial ambitions in mind. Adding options to explore how the budgeting tool assists in setting various types of savings goals (e.g., customizable saving plans, adjustable targets) could improve alignment with the user's goals. Query about preference for automated categorization vs manual entry: Since the user is interested in categorization of expenses, a query about their preference for the automation level of this feature could provide insights into the desired balance of user control versus convenience, directly catering to their interest in automation and user-friendliness.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                                | List of options                                                                                    | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What kind of device do you prefer to use for budgeting?

Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find resources for researching family history on the internet."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify what type of resources they are looking for (websites, online databases, forums, etc.), nor does it indicate any specific focus such as geographical region, time period, or particular aspects of family history they are interested in.

They are looking for platforms that support both English and Polish, do not require registration, offer offline access, and facilitate detailed searches on small towns. Additionally, the user has mentioned their level of expertise and their previous experience with similar platforms, which did not meet their needs. This detailed description provides a clear understanding of the user's task goal and specific preferences.\n\n[VAGUE] False"}], [{"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: How do I take professional-looking photos with my smartphone?"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify the type of photography they are interested in (e.g., portraits, landscapes, macro), the smartphone model they are using, which could affect the recommendation due to different camera capabilities, or whether they are looking for tips on composition, lighting, editing apps, or all of these aspects.

Expand on Queries for a Broader Insight: Although the intent table starts well by asking for the type of photography and smartphone model, it could benefit from questions that delve deeper into the scenarios in which the user plans to take photos. This could include questions about the environments (indoor/outdoor, day/night) and subjects (people, animals, nature) to better tailor advice on settings, angles, and techniques that suit their needs.\n\n2. Incorporate Practical Steps and Common Challenges: Adding a query about common challenges or areas where the user feels they need improvement could guide more personalized advice. For instance, questions about difficulties in achieving the right focus, handling shaky shots, or managing poor lighting conditions would be beneficial.\n\n3. Introduce Guidance for Post-Processing: Given the wide range of editing softwares and apps available, a query on the user's interest in post-processing and editing techniques could enhance the advice provided. This acknowledges the substantial role that editing plays in achieving professional-looking photos.\n\n4. Refine Queries Based on Skill Level: After identifying the user's skill level, follow-up questions could be more tailored. For instance, for a beginner, basic concepts and starting tips could be emphasized, while intermediate and advanced photographers could receive more nuanced advice on composition, lighting, and technical use of their smartphone capabilities.\n\n5. Suggest Resources for Continuous Learning: Concluding the intent table with options for learning resources \u2013 such as online courses, tutorials, books, or community groups \u2013 can not only help in immediate skill improvement but also encourage progressive learning. Queries could also explore if the user prefers self-learning through digital content or interactive community-based learning.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                     | List of options                                                                                                                          | User's response |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What type of photography are you interested in?

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find the most popular vegan recipes this month."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify what criteria are used to define 'popular,' nor does it mention where the user prefers to find these recipes (websites, books, magazines, etc.).

Using layman's terms or providing definitions for potentially complex concepts (like defining what constitutes a 'popular' recipe) could increase clarity.\n4. **Encourage more detailed responses**: The final open-ended query is a good start, but it can be further improved to encourage users to share their thoughts, preferences, or unique requests comprehensively. This could involve asking for user expectations or specific goals they hope to achieve with the recipes.\n5. **Optimize for user comfort and engagement**: Considering the user's ease of navigation through the list, simplifying or categorizing options where possible (e.g., separating diet preferences from allergies) might provide a smoother experience, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                        | List of options                                                                                                                                     | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What criteria do you use to define \"popular\" vegan recipes?

Increase Depth of Options: Provide more nuanced options for price range and brand preferences, allowing users to select multiple brands or a broader price range simultaneously. This flexibility helps accommodate diverse user needs and avoids overly rigid categorization.\n3. Improve Logical Question Sequencing: Rearrange the queries to follow a more natural progression, starting with general interest in smartphone aspects and leading into more detailed questions about brand and price, finishing with options about content type they wish to see (e.g., comparison articles, expert reviews).\n4. Addressing User Needs Proactively: Add a question early in the intent table to inquire about the user's urgency or the timeline of interest (e.g., need information for an immediate purchase or just browsing), which can tailor the urgency and relevance of the provided information.\n5. Expand Encouragement for Detailed Responses: Encourage more detailed responses by introducing a free-text option at certain points, where users can specify unique interests or concerns that might not be covered by predefined options, enriching the data collected and the personalization of the response.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                      | List of options                                                                                                            | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What aspect of smartphones are you most interested in?

If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Check if an email address is associated with spam activities."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal \"Check if an email address is associated with spam activities\" is vague because it does not specify the method or criteria by which the user wants to verify the email address, nor does it mention what type of actions the user intends to take based on the findings.

Include an option to specify unknown terms or ask for explanations on topics like GDPR or HIPAA compliance, accommodating users of different knowledge levels and enhancing clarity.\n3. Add a query regarding past experiences with spam identification to capture user preferences for tools or methods more subtly, thus avoiding assumptions about their knowledge.\n4. Incorporate a direct question about the user's willingness to take additional steps if a tool identifies an email as spam, such as personal follow-up actions or relying on automated processes.\n5.

The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Help me improve my Spanish speaking abilities."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specifics about the user's current level of Spanish, the methods they prefer for improvement, the intensity and frequency of practice they are aiming for, and whether they seek formal instruction, self-study resources, or conversational practice.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Assist me in enhancing my proficiency in speaking Spanish.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                        | List of options                                                                 | User's response |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is your current level of proficiency in Spanish? | Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced                                                |                 |\n| What method of learning do you prefer?                | Self-study, Tutoring, Conversation with native speakers, Language learning apps |                 |\n| How frequently do you wish to practice your Spanish?  | Daily, Several times a week, Weekly, Less frequently                            |                 |\n| Are you looking for formal instruction?               | Yes, No, Not sure                                                               |                 |\n| What is your main goal for improving your Spanish?    | Travel, Business, Education, Personal interest, Other                           |                 |\n| Do you have any additional intent?                    | Specify a particular dialect, Focus on specific vocabulary themes, etc.         |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1.

Introduce a query about the user's previous experience with languages other than their native language, which could provide insights into their learning style and potential challenges they might face.\n4. Consider adding options for user engagement with multimedia resources (such as movies, music, podcasts in Spanish) in the learning preferences query. This would address different learning styles and possibly increase engagement.\n5.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Compare the latest models of hybrid laptops on the market in terms of performance and price."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task is vague because it lacks specific details about the brands or models of hybrid laptops to be compared, the specific aspects of performance they are interested in, and any particular price range they are considering.

This will ensure a comprehensive understanding of the user's needs and preferences. 2. Detailed Weather Options: The current query about weather preferences is quite broad. It could be beneficial to include more specific weather-related questions that may impact beach activities, like \"Do you mind windy conditions?\" or \"Are you planning to visit during a time when jellyfish are prevalent?\" This addresses more detailed user needs and enhances the tailored response. 3. Seasonal Timing: Introduce a query that explores the user's flexibility in travel dates or preferences for specific months, which can help determine the best time for their visit based on typical weather conditions and tourist seasons. 4. Local Events and Activities: Add an option to inquire if the user is interested in local events or activities that might coincide with their beach activities, such as surf competitions, festivals, or conservation activities. This aligns more closely with ensuring the user's experience is enriched and memorable. 5. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback mechanism at the end of the intent table interaction to ask users if their needs were adequately addressed or if they would like to modify any of their previous responses.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6.

For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships.

Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Outline the key events leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task is vague because it does not specify the type of outline desired (e.g., a brief summary, a detailed timeline, academic level, for a presentation, article, or educational purpose), the time frame they are interested in (e.g., a few years, decades, the entire Cold War period), or the depth of detail required.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Provide a summary of the main events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                               | List of options                                                                                                                                                | User's response |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is the purpose of this outline on the Berlin Wall?      | For educational purposes, for a presentation, for personal knowledge, to write an article or paper.                                                            |                 |\n| How detailed should the outline be?                          | A brief overview, a detailed timeline with dates and events, include key figures and their roles.                                                              |                 |\n| Over what time period should the outline cover?              | The last few years before the fall, the entire Cold War period, from the construction to the fall of the Berlin Wall.                                          |                 |\n| Would you like to include the geopolitical context?          | Yes, include global political context, focus only on Germany's internal events, include both but emphasize one over the other.                                 |                 |\n| What format do you prefer for the outline?                   | A written narrative, a bullet-point list, a visual timeline with illustrations.                                                                                |                 |\n| Do you need information on the repercussions after the fall? | Yes, include immediate aftermath, yes but only significant political changes, no, focus on events leading up to the fall only.                                 |                 |\n| Do you have any additional intent or specific requirements?  | Examples: Specific events to include, particular historical figures to focus on, the inclusion of economic factors, a comparison with other historical events. |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1. **Increase Tailored Exploration**: The intent table could explore more deeply by including queries about the user's familiarity with the subject. This can help adjust the level of detail and context in the provided information, ensuring it meets the user's actual knowledge level and interest.\n2. **Encourage More Detailed Responses**: Queries could be enhanced to prompt users to provide more specifics, such as what particular aspects of the geopolitical context are of interest or specific historical figures they are focused on. This would help in generating a more tailored and insightful summary.\n3. **Enhance Logical Sequencing and Flexibility**: While the intent table scores relatively well in logical sequencing, further refining the order of questions to better follow a user\u2019s thought process would improve clarity. For example, asking about the desired level of detail before diving into specific formatting preferences or additional requirements could smooth out the flow of interaction.\n4. **Refine Goal Alignment**: To align more closely with the user\u2019s goal of understanding the main events leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the table could include more direct queries regarding key events or turning points that the user deems most critical.\n5. **Anticipate User Needs More Proactively**: The intent table should incorporate more anticipatory questions that address common areas of interest or confusion regarding the Berlin Wall\u2019s history, such as the influence of specific international treaties or leaders, without the user needing to specify them.\n\nBy refining these aspects, the intent table will better serve the user's intent, making the interaction more efficient and satisfying.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                              | List of options                                                                                                               | User's response |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is the purpose of your research on the Berlin Wall?

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Help me create a monthly budget plan to save for a new car."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific information such as the user's income, expenses, how much they want to save each month, the total amount needed for the new car, the timeline for the savings goal, and any preferences or constraints they might have for their budget plan.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Help me create a monthly budget plan to save for a new car.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                             | List of options                                                                                                        | User's response |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is your total monthly income?

Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Determine the average cost of living in New York City."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal \"Determine the average cost of living in New York City\" is vague because it lacks specific details on what aspects of living costs are of interest (e.g., housing, food, transportation), the time frame for this average, and any particular preferences or constraints (such as family size or lifestyle choices) that might affect the cost.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Determine the average cost of living in New York City, focusing on various expenses.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                              | List of options                                                                    | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What specific categories of living costs are you interested in?                             | Housing, Food, Transportation, Utilities, Other                                    |                 |\n| Are you looking for an average cost for a specific time period?                             | This year, Last year, The past five years, No specific time frame                  |                 |\n| Do you have any specific lifestyle preferences or household size that should be considered? | Single, Couple, Family with children, No preference                                |                 |\n| Would you like to include any additional intent or specifications?                          | Specify budget constraints, Focus on a specific borough, Compare with another city |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1. **Expand Detailed Response Options**: While the intent table allows for some user customization, options for expressing detailed preferences (such as specifying price ranges within budget constraints or preferred neighborhoods within boroughs) could be expanded to better capture user needs.\n2. **Incorporate Contextual Questions**: Include questions that directly ask about the user\u2019s reasons for researching costs (e.g., considering relocation, budgeting for a trip) to tailor the information more precisely to the user\u2019s circumstances.\n3. **Enhance Anticipation of User Needs**: Develop queries that not only respond to user inputs but also proactively anticipate follow-up questions or common concerns, such as typical living cost variations due to seasonal changes or economic fluctuations.\n4. **Improve Logical Sequencing**: Refine the order of questions to build more logically from broad categories to specific details. For instance, starting with the time frame before diving into cost categories might help in understanding the context better before getting into specifics.\n5. **Encourage User Interaction**: Design the intent table to be more interactive by providing a feedback loop, where the user can review and refine their inputs based on preliminary information provided by the AI, enhancing engagement and accuracy of the data tailored to them.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                             | List of options                                                                                     | User's response |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| For what purpose are you researching the cost of living in New York City?

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1.

Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4.

Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: I'm interested in graphic design, can you show me how to create a basic logo using a free online tool?"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal lacks specificity regarding the type of logo they want to create, the features or style they prefer, and which free online tool they are interested in using.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find the recipe of the world's best cocktails."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal is vague as it does not specify what criteria define \"the world's best cocktails.\" Preferences for cocktails can vary widely, and \"best\" could refer to popularity, awards won, taste, uniqueness, or even a specific person's favorite.

Enhance User Customization: To increase user engagement, consider adding a question about the preferred frequency of alerts (e.g., immediately upon deviation, daily review, etc.), which will help tailor the system more closely to user habits and preferences. 2. Refine Open-Ended Options: For queries where \"Other (please specify)\" is an option, provide a brief prompt or example to guide users on how to specify their needs, encouraging more detailed and useful responses. 3. Anticipate and Address Constraints: Include a question about potential limitations the user might face (e.g., limitations due to device compatibility, physical abilities, etc.), ensuring the recommendations are practical and achievable. 4. Clarify and Expand Response Options: In the last query regarding additional intents or preferences, expand the options to cover more specific activities or goals, such as setting progressive targets or integration with dietary tracking, to address a broader range of user needs. 5. Balance Question Detail and Simplicity: While the intent table scores high on clarity, it could delve deeper into the specifics of user preferences without becoming overly complex. For instance, ask if users have a preferred time of day for notifications or if they want motivational messages tied to specific achievements.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Detect network vulnerabilities using Python scripts."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal, \"Detect network vulnerabilities using Python scripts,\" is vague because it does not specify which types of network vulnerabilities to focus on, what the desired output of the detection should be, or any specific environments or constraints related to the Python scripts.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Locate the nearest yoga class with the best reviews in my city."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific information about the city they are in, what they consider to be 'best reviews' (e.g., highest rating, most reviews, etc.), and any personal preferences such as the type of yoga, price range, or class schedule.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Find the nearest yoga class with the highest-rated reviews in my city.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| List of options                                                   | Query for user                                                                 | User's response |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                   | What city are you looking for a yoga class in?                                 |                 |\n| Highest rating, Most positive reviews, Most reviews overall       | What do you consider the best reviews?                                         |                 |\n| Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Bikram, No preference                   | Do you have a preferred type of yoga class?                                    |                 |\n| Budget-friendly, Mid-range, Premium, No preference                | Are you looking for classes within a certain price range?                      |                 |\n| Weekdays, Weekends, Mornings, Afternoons, Evenings, No preference | What days and times are you looking to attend classes?                         |                 |\n|                                                                   | Is there any additional intent you have in mind when looking for a yoga class? |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1.

Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

They have specified the style of music they are interested in (classical), their beginner status, the type of learning methods they prefer (visual, auditory, hands-on), the tools they wish to use (websites and apps), their availability (1-3 hours weekly at flexible times), and what they aim to learn (reading chords and single notes). This level of detail is sufficient to understand their intentions and provide appropriate guidance or resources.\n\n[VAGUE] False"}], [{"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Generate a list of novel and creative tasks."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify the context or purpose for the list of novel and creative tasks.

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Write bash command to check my system specification."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify which system specifications are of interest.

Incorporate Contextual Queries: To further enhance the user's experience, the intent table can include queries that explore the context in which the command will be used, such as whether the system is intended for personal, server, or development use. This tailoring will better align the table with the user's specific environment and needs.\n2. Deepen Exploration of Preferences: While the table offers multiple format options, it could benefit from deeper exploration into why a user might prefer one format over another, or additional customizations they might need within the chosen format (e.g., specific data filters, summary statistics).\n3. Clarify Technical Terms: Although the table is fairly clear, ensuring that all technical terms used are either explained or simplified could make it more accessible to users with less technical background. This is especially important in the queries related to interpreting the data.\n4. Enhance Sequential Logic: Improve the flow of questions to guide the user more naturally through the process of defining their needs, perhaps by starting with the broader context of use before narrowing down to specifics like file format and data interpretation.\n5. Encourage Proactive Feedback: Add a feature to allow users to provide feedback on the options presented, or to request additional options not initially considered. This encourages user interaction and ensures the intent table evolves to meet user expectations more closely.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                        | List of options                                                                                             | User's response |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is the primary context in which you will be using this Bash command?                             | Personal use, Server monitoring, Development environment                                                    |                 |\n| Which specific system specifications are you interested in retrieving?                                | CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network status, hardware details, software versions, running processes |                 |\n| Would you prefer a simplified summary of specs, a detailed report, or visual graphs in your snapshot? | Simplified summaries, detailed reports, visual graphs                                                       |                 |\n| Is there a specific data structure format you prefer for presenting the system specifications?        | List, table, JSON, key-value pairs                                                                          |                 |"}, {"role": "USER", "content": "| Query for user                                                                                        | List of options                                                                                             | User's response                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| What is the primary context in which you will be using this Bash command?                             | Personal use, Server monitoring, Development environment                                                    | Personal use                        |\n| Which specific system specifications are you interested in retrieving?                                | CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network status, hardware details, software versions, running processes | CPU usage, memory usage, disk space |\n| Would you prefer a simplified summary of specs, a detailed report, or visual graphs in your snapshot? | Simplified summaries, detailed reports, visual graphs                                                       | Simplified summaries                |\n| Is there a specific data structure format you prefer for presenting the system specifications?        | List, table, JSON, key-value pairs                                                                          | JSON                                |"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[SUMMARY] The user needs a Bash command crafted for personal use that fetches simplified JSON-formatted data on CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space, and saves this information to a file.

Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: What equipment do I need to start astrophotography?"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details regarding their current knowledge, equipment preferences, budget, and the specific type of astrophotography they are interested in (such as deep sky, planetary, or wide-field).

Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Write a script to automate emails for a list of recipients based on certain events."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details about the type of script they want, the events that should trigger the emails, the content of the emails, the email platform to be used, and any personal preferences for how the script should function.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9.

Incorporate an option for users to specify the level of detail needed in the hardware information, like basic, intermediate, or advanced, which would help tailor the response more accurately to the user's expertise and needs. 2. Add a query to understand the user's context or reason for needing the hardware information, which could influence the type of data provided (e.g., for troubleshooting, inventory, performance evaluation). 3. Introduce a question regarding the user's preference for command complexity, which can cater to users with varying levels of familiarity with bash commands (e.g., simple one-liners vs. more complex scripts). 4. Replace the binary Yes/No option for hardware diagnostic tests with a more engaging query that explores what specific tests the user might be interested in or the purpose of these tests. 5.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find a traditional recipe for French onion soup."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify what constitutes a \"traditional\" recipe in terms of specific preferences or requirements such as region, complexity, dietary restrictions, or particular ingredients.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Develop a concept for a mobile game that teaches basic math."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details about the target audience, platform preferences, game genre, and the depth of math concepts to be covered.

For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Analyze the performance of the tech sector in the stock market last quarter."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details that would help in understanding their exact needs.

Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Explain how to encrypt my emails for privacy."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details on how they wish to encrypt their emails, what email service they use, and their technical comfort level with implementing encryption.

If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Devise a checklist for securing personal online accounts."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal of devising a checklist for securing personal online accounts is vague because it lacks specifics about what types of online accounts the user is interested in securing (e.g., social media, financial, email), the user's current level of security knowledge, and any particular security concerns or preferences they might have.

It also outlines the context (user-friendly, suitable for home and public Wi-Fi) and the adaptability requirements (personal and team scenarios, balancing high security with ease of use), providing enough details to understand and execute the task without further clarification.\n\n[VAGUE] False"}], [{"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1.

The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Find the cheapest round-trip flights from New York to London next month."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details such as the preferred dates for departure and return, the preferred airline or alliance, the acceptable range of flight times, and whether they are looking for any particular class of service (economy, business, first class).

Clarify the importance of each preference: Users may prioritize certain aspects over others (e.g., price over convenience). Asking users to rank their preferences or specify deal-breakers can tailor the search more effectively.\n3. Explore alternative airports and flexibility: Inquire about the user's willingness to use alternative airports or adjust dates for better pricing, as this can significantly impact the cost of flights.\n4. Offer assistance with additional travel components: Users looking for flights may also need help with accommodations or transportation; offering to assist with these can provide a more comprehensive service.\n5.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7.

It specifies the type of activity (cognitive exercises), duration (10-30 minutes daily), medium (non-digital), and previous experience (none). Additionally, it outlines specific personal challenges and needs such as stress-related memory issues, lack of motivation, a desire for progress tracking, and a request for diverse options.

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5.

Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points.

Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Propose an idea for a community mural."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal of proposing an idea for a community mural is vague as it lacks specific details about the preferences, purpose, community context, size, and potential themes for the mural.

Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6.

Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

Clarify the Context of the Summary: The intent table could inquire about the context in which the summary will be used (e.g., for a report, presentation, or study material), to ensure that the summary is fit for purpose. 2. Specify Source Material: Adding a query about the type of text file (e.g., a novel, research paper, technical documentation) could help tailor the summary to the key aspects of the text's genre or field. 3. Prioritize User Requirements: Consider asking how the user plans to use the summary, if there's a preference for certain details to be highlighted, or if there's a strict word limit to follow. 4. Address Confidentiality and Sensitivity: If the text file contains sensitive information, the intent table should include a question about confidentiality requirements or any content that should be omitted. 5.

Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7.

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: What are the current trends in sustainable fashion?"}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task is vague because it does not specify the type of trends (e.g., materials, styles, consumer behavior), the geographical focus (global trends or specific regions), or the time frame for \"current.\" The user might be interested in a specific aspect of sustainable fashion, which is not clarified.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] What are the latest trends in sustainable fashion?\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                                                                           | List of options                                                           | User's response |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Are you looking for trends related to materials, styles, or practices in sustainable fashion?                                                            | Materials, Styles, Practices, All of the above                            |                 |\n| Which geographical region's trends in sustainable fashion are you interested in?                                                                         | Global, North America, Europe, Asia, Other specific region                |                 |\n| What time frame do you consider as \"current\" for these trends?                                                                                           | Past year, Past two years, Past five years, Ongoing                       |                 |\n| Would you like to know about the trends from the perspective of consumers, designers, or manufacturers?                                                  | Consumers, Designers, Manufacturers, All perspectives                     |                 |\n| Do you have any additional intent that you would like to specify, such as sustainable fashion in a specific price range or for a particular demographic? | Price range, Demographic, Specific brands/designers, No additional intent |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\nEnhance Option Variety and Flexibility: Consider adding options that encompass new and innovative sustainable fashion trends like upcycling or zero-waste designs.

For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3.

For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Devise a vegetarian recipe using only ingredients already in my pantry."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specific details about the ingredients available in the pantry, as well as any preferences or dietary restrictions beyond being vegetarian.

Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10.

There is sufficient detail to understand the user's intention without needing additional information.\n\n[VAGUE] False"}], [{"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: List tips for packing light on a week-long trip."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify the type of trip, destination, climate, or personal preferences, which are all important factors when considering how to pack light.

Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6.

Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points.

Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Research and summarize the top five productivity apps for students."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it does not specify the criteria for selecting the top five productivity apps (e.g., based on user ratings, features, cost), the type of students (e.g., high school, college, graduate), or the platform (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows).

The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Determine the most efficient algorithm for predicting stock prices based on historical data."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The user's task goal is vague because it lacks specifics about the type of stocks (e.g., individual stocks, stock indices, sectors), the time frame for prediction (short-term, medium-term, long-term), the historical data depth (e.g., 5 years, 10 years), and the user's definition of \"most efficient\" (e.g., accuracy, computational efficiency, ease of implementation).

Enhance Engagement: While the table does engage the user, introducing interactive elements or examples of how specific inputs (e.g., technical indicators) have impacted predictions historically could further enhance engagement and user understanding. Refine Logical Sequencing: Although the question order generally follows a logical sequence, restructuring to first ask about the user's expertise level and then tailoring the complexity of subsequent questions accordingly could improve the flow and user experience. User Customization: Adding a question about previous experience with stock price prediction or related financial modeling could help customize the tool's complexity and relevance to the user's specific expertise and needs. Anticipate Additional Needs: Consider questions on integration with other data sources or systems the user might be using, which could make the implementation of the chosen algorithm more seamless and contextually appropriate.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                                | List of options                                                                                                                                | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is your experience level with stock price prediction models?

Add more nuanced options or sub-questions to the primary health goal and dietary preferences queries to capture more detailed information, such as \"What type of weight loss are you interested in?\" or \"Any particular reason for dietary restrictions?\". 3. Incorporate a question about the user's past experiences with diet plans, if any, to learn from previous successes or challenges and to avoid repeating unwanted strategies. 4. Provide an option for the user to state their preferred method of support or follow-up, such as a mobile app, online community, or regular check-ins, which can help maintain their engagement with the diet plan. 5. Ask about the user's time availability for meal preparation and cooking, which is a practical consideration that can greatly affect the feasibility and sustainability of a diet plan.\n\n[IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                                | List of options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What is your primary health goal with this diet plan?                                                         | Weight loss, Muscle gain, Managing a health condition, General well-being                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                 |\n| Could you specify your goal for weight loss or muscle gain if applicable?                                     | Fat loss, Lean muscle building, Bulking up, Maintaining current muscle mass                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                 |\n| Do you have any dietary preferences or restrictions?                                                          | Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-free, Dairy-free, No restrictions                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                 |\n| Can you specify any particular reason for choosing your dietary preferences or restrictions?                  | Ethical reasons, Health issues, Personal taste, No specific reason                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 |\n| How would you describe your current activity level?                                                           | Sedentary (little or no exercise), Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week), Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week), Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week), Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) |                 |\n| Are there any specific foods or nutrients you want to include or avoid in your diet plan?                     | Include: (e.g., high protein, high fiber), Avoid: (e.g., low carb, low sugar)                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                 |\n| Do you have any known allergies or medical conditions that should be considered when creating your diet plan? | Yes (please specify), No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                 |\n| Have you tried any diet plans in the past?

They have specified age and gender (30-year-old male), a focus on general well-being, no dietary restrictions, and a moderate activity level. The user also mentions specific dietary preferences (high in fiber, low in sugar), a requirement for dietitian oversight, a time frame for daily meal preparation (30 minutes to 1 hour), and a preference for Mediterranean-style meals. These details are sufficient to understand the user's intention and to begin creating a tailored diet plan.\n\n[VAGUE] False"}], [{"role": "SYSTEM", "content": "You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.\n--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---\n1. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.\n2. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.\n--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---\n1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Establish a daily care schedule for a puppy Labrador."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal is vague because it does not specify key details such as the age of the Labrador, any specific health or dietary needs, the current routine if any, the amount of time the owner can dedicate to the puppy's care, or preferences for scheduling activities throughout the day.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Create a daily care routine for a young Labrador puppy.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                 | List of options                                                             | User's response |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| How old is your Labrador puppy?                                                                | Below 3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, Over 12 months                     |                 |\n| Does your puppy have any specific dietary or health needs?                                     | Yes, specific dietary needs, Yes, health needs, No specific needs, Not sure |                 |\n| Do you have a current routine for your puppy?                                                  | Yes, I have a routine, No, I'm starting from scratch, Not sure              |                 |\n| How much time can you dedicate to your puppy's care daily?                                     | Less than 2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, More than 6 hours                  |                 |\n| What time do you prefer your puppy to start its day?                                           | Before 6 AM, Between 6-8 AM, After 8 AM                                     |                 |\n| What types of activities do you want to include in your puppy's care routine?                  | Feeding, Walking, Training, Playtime, Rest, Grooming                        |                 |\n| Would you like to include any socialization or group activities?                               | Yes, with other dogs, Yes, with humans, No, not yet, Not sure               |                 |\n| Do you have any preference for the puppy's bedtime?                                            | Early night (before 9 PM), Late night (after 9 PM), No preference           |                 |\n| Is there any other specific requirement or preference you have for your puppy's care schedule? | Examples: specific meal times, training goals, etc.                         |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1. **Enhance Tailored Exploration:** Add questions about specific behavior traits or concerns, which could tailor the routine more closely to the puppy\u2019s personality and owner's experience level.\n2. **Balance Flexibility and Detail:** Include more open-ended options under queries about dietary, health needs, and specific requirements to capture detailed preferences and nuances not covered by the predefined choices.\n3. **Incorporate Contextual Understanding:** Introduce queries regarding the owner\u2019s experience with dogs or any other pets to better align advice with the owner's capabilities and circumstances.\n4. **Increase Option Range:** For questions about time dedication and types of activities, provide more granular options or a way for the user to specify other activities or time commitments outside the provided ranges.\n5. **Address Environmental and Lifestyle Factors:** Add queries considering the living environment (e.g., apa...

Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Write unit tests for a simple Python program."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task goal of writing unit tests for a simple Python program is vague because it lacks specific details about the Python program, such as its functionality, which modules or features need testing, the testing framework preferred (if any), and any particular standards or coverage goals the user aims to achieve with these tests.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Write unit tests for a simple Python program.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                                                                   | List of options                                                               | User's response |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What functionality does your Python program perform that you need to test?                                       | Mathematical calculations, Web scraping, Data analysis, Other                 |                 |\n| Which modules or features of your Python program are you looking to test?                                        | Specific functions, Classes, User interactions, Other                         |                 |\n| Do you have a preferred testing framework for writing these unit tests?                                          | unittest, pytest, No preference                                               |                 |\n| Are there any specific standards or coverage goals you aim to achieve with these unit tests?                     | Coverage percentage (please specify), Compliance with coding standards, Other |                 |\n| Do you need examples of unit tests for similar functionality, or are you looking for guidance on best practices? | Examples of unit tests, Best practices guidance, Both, Neither                |                 |\n| Please share any additional intent or specific requirements you have for writing these unit tests.               | Testing under specific conditions, Mocking external dependencies, Other       |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1. **Identify Testing Phases**: Incorporate queries to understand if the user is in the initial stages of writing tests or improving existing ones.

If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.\n2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.\n3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.\n4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.\n5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).\n6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.\n--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.\n2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.\n--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---\n1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].\n3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.\n--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---\n1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.\n2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.\n\n# Good intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries\nDescription: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.\n2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage\nDescription: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.\n3. Title: User Engagement and Customization\nDescription: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.\n4. Title: Clarity and Understandability\nDescription: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.\n5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing\nDescription: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.\n6. Title: User-Centric Approach\nDescription: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.\n7. Title: Goal Alignment\nDescription: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.\n8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs\nDescription: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.\n9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses\nDescription: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.\n10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility\nDescription: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.\n\n# Bad intent table rubrics\n1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth\nDescription: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.\n2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning\nDescription: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.\n3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration\nDescription: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.\n4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure\nDescription: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.\n5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity\nDescription: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.\n6. Title: Missed Essential Queries\nDescription: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.\n7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent\nDescription: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user\u2019s original request.\n8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints\nDescription: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.\n9. Title: Premature Specificity\nDescription: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.\n10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest\nDescription: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.\n\n\nHere is the user's initial task goal: Research and summarize the concept of blockchain and its applications."}, {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "[JUDGMENT THOUGHT] The task of researching and summarizing the concept of blockchain and its applications is vague because it lacks specific details on the depth of the research, the specific applications of interest, the purpose of the summary, and the desired format or length of the summary.\n\n[VAGUE] True\n\n[EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] Research and summarize the concept of blockchain technology and its various applications.\n\n[IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE]\n| Query for user                                                            | List of options                                                                         | User's response |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| What depth of detail do you need for the blockchain concept?              | Detailed technical analysis, Overview, Both detailed and overview                       |                 |\n| Are there specific applications of blockchain you are interested in?      | Cryptocurrencies, Supply chain management, Voting systems, Others, No preference        |                 |\n| What is the purpose of this summary?                                      | Academic use, Business analysis, Personal knowledge, Other                              |                 |\n| What format or length do you prefer for the summary?                      | A short article (1-2 pages), A detailed report (5+ pages), Bullet points, No preference |                 |\n| Do you have any additional intent or specific requirements for this task? | Focus on ethical considerations, Compare with traditional systems                       |                 |\n\n[IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS]\n1.
